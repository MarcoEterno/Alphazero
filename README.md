# Alphazero-like Monte Carlo tree search

This repo is an implementation of the monte carlo tree search (MCTS)
algorithm for the game of tic-tac-toe. 

The repo has been made in preparation for a Large Language model project, 
where the MCTS algorithm is used to explore all the possible decoding 
paths of language models, and choose the best one. 

This repo is intended for personal use only.
